## Description

**HICosmo** is a specialized Python package dedicated to exploring the cosmos through neutral hydrogen intensity mapping observations. Developed as part of a robust research initiative, this package aims to facilitate various cosmological studies, including:

- **Neutral Hydrogen Mapping:** Enhancing the quality of neutral hydrogen intensity maps, mitigating the effects of foreground interference, and elevating signal reliability.
- **Cosmic Probes:** Collaborating with multiple observations to create precise probes for exploring the universeâ€™s late stages, focusing primarily on the elusive dark energy.
- **Cosmological Principles:** Leveraging vast redshift ranges and comprehensive sky coverage, enabling meticulous testing and verification of fundamental cosmological principles.

## Features

- **Foreground Mitigation:** Tools for the removal of foreground contamination in neutral hydrogen maps.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Features allowing for the cross-correlation of SKA neutral hydrogen surveys with other cosmological observations.
- **Unified Constraints:** Combining diverse observational data to derive enriched cosmological insights.
- **Cosmological Principle Verification:** Utilizing extensive datasets to scrutinize and reaffirm core cosmological doctrines.

## Description
**HICosmo** is an evolving Python package dedicated to exploring the cosmos through neutral hydrogen intensity mapping observations. While still under development, this package already offers capabilities for estimating cosmological parameters using observational data. Future updates will progressively enhance its functionalities. Developed as part of a robust research initiative, this package aims to facilitate various cosmological studies, including:

- **Neutral Hydrogen Mapping:** Enhancing the quality of neutral hydrogen intensity maps, mitigating the effects of foreground interference, and elevating signal reliability.
- **Cosmic Probes:** Collaborating with multiple observations to create precise probes for exploring the universeâ€™s late stages, focusing primarily on the elusive dark energy.
- **Cosmological Principles:** Leveraging vast redshift ranges and comprehensive sky coverage, enabling meticulous testing and verification of fundamental cosmological principles.

## Features

- **Foreground Mitigation:** Tools for the removal of foreground contamination in neutral hydrogen maps.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Features allowing for the cross-correlation of SKA neutral hydrogen surveys with other cosmological observations.
- **Unified Constraints:** Combining diverse observational data to derive enriched cosmological insights.
- **Cosmological Principle Verification:** Utilizing extensive datasets to scrutinize and reaffirm core cosmological doctrines.
